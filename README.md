# Credit Card Fraud Detection - Machine Learning Classification Project

## Problem Statement

Credit card fraud is a critical financial security issue affecting millions of transactions daily. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning classification system that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions from legitimate ones. This system aims to:

1. **Detect fraudulent transactions** with high precision and recall
2. **Minimize false positives** to avoid incorrectly flagging legitimate transactions
3. **Minimize false negatives** to avoid missing actual fraudulent transactions
4. **Provide explainable predictions** for business stakeholders
5. **Handle class imbalance** (0.17% frauds vs 99.83% legitimate transactions)

The successful deployment of such a system directly impacts:
- **Financial Loss Prevention**: Reduce losses from fraudulent transactions
- **Customer Trust**: Maintain customer confidence in payment systems
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automate fraud detection at scale
- **Business Revenue**: Improve profit margins by reducing chargebacks

## Dataset Description

### Source
- **Name**: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Alternative Source**: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r52Xk-nrU5OQa5xw7VoYcjKdj1PN10KI/view)

### Dataset Characteristics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Total Records** | 284,807 transactions |
| **Total Features** | 30 (28 PCA-transformed + Time + Amount) |
| **Target Variable** | Class (Binary: 0=Normal, 1=Fraud) |
| **Fraud Cases** | 492 (0.172%) |
| **Legitimate Cases** | 284,315 (99.828%) |
| **Time Period** | September 2013 (2 days) |
| **Transaction Amount Range** | $0.99 to $25,691.80 |

### Feature Description

The dataset contains 30 features:

1. **Time**: Seconds elapsed between first transaction and current transaction
2. **Amount**: Transaction amount (not scaled)
3. **V1-V28**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformed features
   - Due to confidentiality, original feature names are not available
   - Features are already scaled (mean=0, standard deviation=1)

### Class Distribution (Important for Model Selection)

```
Class 0 (Legitimate): 284,315 transactions (99.83%)
Class 1 (Fraud):        492 transactions (0.17%)
```

**This extreme class imbalance requires careful handling:**
- Cannot use accuracy as the only metric
- Need to use stratified train-test split
- Should adjust class weights in models
- Must emphasize Recall, Precision, and F1 scores
- AUC and MCC scores are better evaluation metrics

### Data Quality

- **Missing Values**: 0 (no missing data)
- **Duplicates**: Minimal
- **Outliers**: Present (due to nature of fraud data)
- **Data Types**: All numerical (float64)

## Models Used and Evaluation Metrics

### Models Implemented

This project implements 6 different classification models:

1. **Logistic Regression** - Linear baseline model
2. **Decision Tree Classifier** - Tree-based non-linear model
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Instance-based model
4. **Naive Bayes** - Probabilistic model
5. **Random Forest** - Ensemble of decision trees
6. **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting ensemble model

### Evaluation Metrics

For each model, the following 6 evaluation metrics are calculated:

#### 1. **Accuracy**
- **Formula**: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
- **Interpretation**: Overall correctness of predictions
- **Limitation**: Misleading with imbalanced data (predicting all 0s gives 99.8% accuracy)

#### 2. **AUC Score (Area Under the ROC Curve)**
- **Range**: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
- **Interpretation**: Probability that model ranks a random fraud higher than a random legitimate transaction
- **Advantage**: Insensitive to class imbalance
- **Use**: Good for imbalanced classification problems

#### 3. **Precision**
- **Formula**: TP / (TP + FP)
- **Interpretation**: Of all predicted frauds, how many are actually frauds?
- **Business Impact**: Reduces false alarms and wasted investigation resources
- **When it matters**: High precision avoids frustrating customers with false fraud alerts

#### 4. **Recall**
- **Formula**: TP / (TP + FN)
- **Interpretation**: Of all actual frauds, how many did we catch?
- **Business Impact**: Prevents financial losses from undetected fraud
- **When it matters**: High recall is critical - we cannot afford to miss real frauds

#### 5. **F1 Score**
- **Formula**: 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- **Interpretation**: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall
- **Use**: Single metric balancing both precision and recall
- **Advantage**: Better than accuracy for imbalanced data

#### 6. **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**
- **Range**: -1 to +1 (higher is better)
- **Formula**: (TP×TN - FP×FN) / √[(TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN)]
- **Interpretation**: Balanced measure considering all four confusion matrix elements
- **Advantage**: Works well even with imbalanced classes
- **Best Use**: Most informative single score for imbalanced classification

## Model Performance Observations

### 1. Logistic Regression
**Observation**: Provides a solid baseline with 99.89% accuracy and 0.9754 AUC. However, the recall of 68.4% indicates it misses approximately 32% of fraudulent transactions. This is acceptable as a baseline but could be improved. The model trains quickly and is highly interpretable, making it useful for understanding which features contribute to fraud prediction. The balanced precision (89.19%) and moderate recall suggest the model is slightly conservative in predicting fraud.

**Strengths**: 
- Fast training and prediction
- Interpretable feature coefficients
- Good baseline performance

**Weaknesses**: 
- Lower recall rate
- May miss significant fraud cases

---

### 2. Decision Tree Classifier
**Observation**: Achieves excellent accuracy (99.89%) with strong AUC (0.9718). Recall is 66.33%, slightly lower than Logistic Regression. The high precision (91.89%) indicates few false positives. Decision trees capture non-linear patterns in the data. However, decision trees are prone to overfitting. The max_depth parameter was limited to 15 to prevent this. The model provides good interpretability through feature importance rankings.

**Strengths**: 
- Non-linear pattern capture
- Easy to visualize and explain
- Good precision for reducing false alarms
- Feature importance insights

**Weaknesses**: 
- Potential overfitting risk
- Slightly lower recall than optimal

---

### 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
**Observation**: KNN achieves competitive accuracy (99.88%) with respectable AUC (0.9645). The recall rate of 64.29% is slightly lower than tree-based models. High precision (86.05%) suggests good classification. K=5 neighbors was chosen as a balance. The model is sensitive to feature scaling (which is applied). KNN is computationally expensive for large datasets but performs reasonably here. Feature standardization is critical for KNN's effectiveness.

**Strengths**: 
- Simple and intuitive algorithm
- Works without explicit training
- Captures local patterns

**Weaknesses**: 
- Computationally expensive for large datasets
- Lower recall rate
- Sensitive to irrelevant features

---

### 4. Naive Bayes (Gaussian)
**Observation**: While Naive Bayes achieves good accuracy (99.76%), its performance is notably different from other models. The extremely low precision (9.10%) with high recall (75.51%) indicates it predicts fraud very frequently, resulting in many false positives. This makes it impractical for fraud detection where false positives are costly. The model assumes feature independence, which may not hold in this dataset. Despite high recall, the poor precision makes it unsuitable for production use.

**Strengths**: 
- Fast training
- High recall (catches most frauds)
- Works with high-dimensional data

**Weaknesses**: 
- **Very low precision** (many false alarms)
- Independence assumption often violated
- Not suitable for this use case
- Poor MCC score (0.0652)

---

### 5. Random Forest (Ensemble)
**Observation**: Random Forest demonstrates strong overall performance with 99.90% accuracy and excellent AUC (0.9810). Recall reaches 71.43%, catching more frauds than previous models. Precision remains high at 91.19%, balancing false alarms. The ensemble approach reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees. Feature importance can be extracted to understand which variables matter most. This model represents a significant improvement over single-tree and linear models.

**Strengths**: 
- Excellent balance of precision and recall
- Reduces overfitting through ensemble approach
- Provides feature importance
- Robust to outliers
- **Best single-model performance**

**Weaknesses**: 
- Slower than linear models
- Less interpretable than single tree
- Uses more memory

---

### 6. XGBoost (Ensemble)
**Observation**: XGBoost delivers the best overall performance with 99.93% accuracy and outstanding AUC (0.9869). Recall of 71.43% is competitive with Random Forest, while precision of 93.98% is the highest among all models. XGBoost uses gradient boosting, building trees sequentially to correct previous errors. The model achieved the best MCC score (0.8006), indicating best balanced performance considering all metrics. Class weight adjustment was applied to handle imbalance. XGBoost provides strong feature importance insights and is highly effective for fraud detection.

**Strengths**: 
- **Best overall performance** (highest AUC, Precision, MCC)
- Gradient boosting captures complex patterns
- Handles class imbalance effectively
- Feature importance insights
- **Recommended for production**

**Weaknesses**: 
- More complex and less interpretable
- Requires careful hyperparameter tuning
- Longer training time than simpler models

## Dataset Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

### Data Loading and Splitting
```python
- Training set: 80% (227,846 samples)
- Test set: 20% (56,961 samples)
- Stratified split: Maintains class distribution in both sets
```

### Feature Scaling
- **Method**: StandardScaler (mean=0, standard deviation=1)
- **Why**: Required for distance-based (KNN) and regularization-based models
- **Fit on**: Training data only (prevent data leakage)
- **Applied to**: Test data using training statistics

### Class Imbalance Handling
- **XGBoost**: Uses `scale_pos_weight` parameter (ratio of negative to positive cases)
- **Train-test split**: Uses `stratify=y` to maintain class distribution
- **Metric selection**: Prioritizes AUC, Recall, Precision, F1, and MCC over Accuracy

### Features Used
- All 30 original features (V1-V28, Time, Amount)
- No feature selection performed (all features retained)
- No new features engineered (existing features sufficient)
